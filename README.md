- Shenzhen (China)

## 🎯 Objective
1. Identify which factory had the highest machine breakdowns.
2. Determine which machine types failed most frequently.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Tableau
- JSON Dataset
- Data Cleaning

## 📊 Key Insights
- Compared breakdown frequency across locations
- Identified high-risk machines
- Built interactive dashboard for monitoring failures
